First order of business:
    * Get the script working in the browser
    * Access the DOM from the extention

UI - Browser
    * Grab the one element (recipe) and delete the rest of it
    * Scroll to the recipe

    * deleted element from test site within recipe element id="AdThrive_Recipe_1_desktop"
    id="AdThrive_Recipe_1_tablet"
    class="adthrive-ad adthrive-recipe adthrive-recipe-1 adthrive-ad-cls"
    class="mv-ad-box"

UI - Popup
    * Might not need a popup at all - depends on what we want the user to be able to do once they run the extention
        * Chat GPT - take the DOM,
        * Save recipes
